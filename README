Trending Topics application
===========================

A prototype of Twitter's trending topics feature. This program shows the top 10 most frequently used word in Twitter in the last 5 minutes

The following things can be customizable in the program :

   - Whether or not to show the trending topics in the output
   - Whether or not to show a leaderboard like stats of the database reads and write rates 
   - Control the number of worker threads which write and read from the database

These can be adjusted by the command line arguments


How to run the program:
---------------------
First the ./run.sh script has to be run. The following tells what the script takes as arguments and what they do.


run.sh actions
-----------

run.sh               : compile all Java clients and stored procedures, build the catalog, and start the server
run.sh clean         : remove compiled files

After the server is started, the script 'readTweets.py' can be run from the command line. The script takes the following arguments: 

python readTweet.py       	: Runs the program but does not show any output
python readTweet.py -t    	: Runs the program and shows the trending topics every 5 seconds
python readTweet.py -l    	: Runs the program and shows a leaderboard-like statistics
python readTweet.py -w <count>  : Runs the program using <count> number of worker threads. The worker threads
				  interact with the database
 
The options can be combined with each other

Interpreting the Results
------------------------
The trending topics are a simple list of 10 words. (Note: The 'u' before each word says that they are in unicode.)

The leaderboard outputs the following list :

<count> words per second  	: This is the number of words processed by the application
Total tweets : <count>		: This is the total number of tweets handled till now
Reads per sec :  <count>	: This is the average number of database reads per sec happened in the last 5 seconds
Writes per sec : <count>	: The average number of database writes per sec in the last 5 seconds
Updates per sec : <count>	: The average number of database updates per sec in the last 5 seconds
